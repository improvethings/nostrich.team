As nostr expands, there are two things I would like to see, and that's the intention of creating nostr.team

- There will always be an active campaign to improve branding and awareness:
  - As of writing this, for every supporter of this site, I will design and send you a custom t-shirt.

- Fund the active development of professional / business services on the nostr protocol
  - 10% of all profits will be sent as sats to the active development of professional products or services on nostr
  - My own profits will be used to begin the development of an [open and decentralized voting platform](https://krisconstable.com/open-and-decentralized-online-voting/) on nostr
